The version contained here is a branch of the basic code designed to find the density profile under the constraint of a prescribed adsorption. The udate routine performs a constrained minimisation similar to that described in Adam P. Hughes, Uwe Thiele, and Andrew J. Archer, The Journal of Chemical Physics 142, 074702 (2015) 

As an example the program can find the profile and surface tension for a state point near drying. The following parameters do this for an adsorption Gamma=-4.0 and attractive wall strength ew=0.001 at a subcritical coexistence state point
corresponding to  T=1.022566 for which the bulk liquid density rho=0.597845620728.

Note that by repeating for a range of adsorption values, one can use
the composite free energy to construct the binding potential as
described in the above reference.
